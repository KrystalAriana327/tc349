  <li>&nbsp;&ldquo;Life&rsquo;s journey is not to arrive at the grave safely in a well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, totally worn out, shouting &lsquo;Holy shitâ€¦what a ride!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
-Hunter S. Thompson </li>
  <li>&quot; ... imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, 'This is an interesting world I find myself in - an interesting hole I find myself in - fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. &quot; Douglas Adams&nbsp;</li>
