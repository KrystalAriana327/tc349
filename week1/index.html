	<img src= "Grad.jpg" alt="Me" id="Krystal">
	<p> First off, I would like to start by saying that my name is Krystal Stinson. I was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan and I am a graduating senior. Once this first summer session is over I would have finished my time here at Michigan State. It's been quite a journey but I'm looking forward to whatever lies ahead. </p>
		<p>I enjoy drawing, reading, and designing in my free time. My goal is to eventually open up my own design business. I may not know everything there is to know about designing but I'm always willing to learn</p>

	<h2>Development Environment/How I work</h2>
	<p>As of right now, I do all of my work on my Macbook Pro. It's only a 13 inch laptop but it serves its purpose. I'm considering buying a iMac to work on any future design projects. Having a laptop is convienent but sometimes I find my face getting closer to the screen the longer I use it. I definitely need a bigger screen! </p>
	<p> In addition to my Macbook, there are a few other essential tools I use when designing. They include:
		<ul>
			<li> Wacom Tablet</li>
			<li> Mouse </li>
			<li> Canon DSLR </li>
		</ul> </p>
<p>I don't know what I would do without my Wacom Tablet. It makes everything so much easier! As far as software goes, I mostly use Adobe's Creative Suite. Recently since I have a Digital sculpting class, I am also experimenting with Zbrush. </p>
<p> I find that it's easier to work with music or the TV going in the background. For some it can be a distraction, but I think that it gets my "creative juices" flowing. </p>
